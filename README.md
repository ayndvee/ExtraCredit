### Github
I had a bit of experience with git and github. But it's definitely helpful to create repository, get familiarized with basic commands like git add., git commit and git push. which are essential for remote repos. One new command I learned was "touch" which creates files.

### Zenhub
Zenhub is a project management tool that is integrated with github, it has a browser extension and is built for agile teams.

These tools help visualize the tasks, with work, in progress and to do lists. It provides reports to see the teams progress with the help of the sprint system and story points. Since zenhub is built in with github its easier as we don't need to switch tools. With these features we can better manage the project and make better decisions.
